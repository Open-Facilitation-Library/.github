# Open Facilitation Library

Open standards for AI-assisted facilitation and deliberative democracy.

> "GitHub for facilitation workflows" — machine-readable, composable facilitation methodologies that AI systems can understand and apply.

## What is OFL?

OFL develops machine-readable facilitation patterns, evaluation frameworks, and a shared knowledge base for the deliberative democracy community. Patterns are defined in YAML using the **Why-How-Who framework**, making them composable and interpretable by AI facilitators.

## Repositories

| Repository | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**synthesis**](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/synthesis) | Knowledge base, evaluation frameworks, research references |
| [**skills**](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/skills) | Machine-readable facilitation patterns (YAML) |
| [**cross-pollination**](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/cross-pollination) | Opinion exposure algorithms and experiments |
| [**evals**](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/evals) | Evaluation frameworks — Why-How-Who conversation signatures |

## The Why-How-Who Framework

Every facilitation pattern follows a three-part structure:

- **Why** — Purpose and outcomes (agreement building, ideation, conflict resolution)
- **How** — Process and techniques (format, interaction mode, question types, timing)
- **Who** — Participants and dynamics (group size, roles, power dynamics)

## Current Patterns

| Pattern | Category | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Cross-Pollination | Deliberative | Expose participants to diverse opinions beyond vote aggregation |
| Delphi Method | Deliberative | Iterative expert consensus through structured rounds |
| Six Thinking Hats | Generative | Parallel thinking modes for ideation |
| Retrospective | Generative | Team reflection and improvement |
