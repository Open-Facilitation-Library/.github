# Open Facilitation Library

Open standards for AI-assisted facilitation and deliberative democracy.

## What is OFL?

OFL develops open standards for AI agents that facilitate group conversations — deliberation, research interviews, dispute resolution, innovation workshops, and more. The project spans three complementary layers:

- **[Skills](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/skills)** — Executable agent skills following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), designed for platforms like Harmonica or OpenClaw
- **[Workflows](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/workflows)** — How 14 real platforms orchestrate AI agents to facilitate group processes
- **[Synthesis](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/synthesis)** — Knowledge base, research watchlist, and automated paper discovery via Semantic Scholar API

Plus supporting repos:

- **[Evals](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/evals)** — Why-How-Who evaluation framework for assessing AI facilitator performance
- **[Cross-Pollination](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/cross-pollination)** — Opinion exposure algorithms and experiments
